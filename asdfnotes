----------
positioning can start combat / diplomacy / trading


technology affects resources / spacecraft / opponent spacecraft


----------
start with fixed technology model
fixed positioning: 3d cartesian
  mass
  acceleration
  manuevering
  gravity
  collision detection

possible accelerations determine velocity and ultimately position cone.
*** concentrate here to flesh out ideas.

in space, decisions are:
  navigation
  acceleration
  combat action

on planet / station, decisions are:
  ship upgrades
  provisioning
  navigation
  intelligence
  trading

fixed combat model
  sensors / stealth
  targeting (active, passive)
  six areas (front, 4 sides, rear)
  weapons (beam, missile): targeting and damage
  shielding: damage reduction, recharge
  armor: damage reduction, damaged w/o replacement
